## Migrations

### 2025-01 | Monorepo Restructure (v0 Import)

**Type**: Architecture  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Impact**: All developers, entire codebase

**Description**:
Consolidated all v0 code into a structured monorepo using pnpm workspaces. Preserved all 239 files from original v0 implementation without feature loss.

**Changes**:
- Created `packages/api/` for Cloudflare Worker
- Created `packages/frontend/` for Vite + React app
- Created `packages/si-core/` for shared AI intelligence
- Established `imports/v0-*` directory for historical reference
- Moved to pnpm workspaces from separate repositories

**Rationale**:
- Simplified dependency management
- Enabled code sharing between packages
- Improved development workflow
- Maintained all v0 functionality

**Migration Path**:
```powershell
# Old structure (separate repos)
/cognomega-api
/cognomega-frontend
/cognomega-ai

# New structure (monorepo)
/cognomega-edge
  /packages/api
  /packages/frontend
  /packages/si-core
```

**Breaking Changes**: None (all features preserved)

**Related Files**:
- `_reports/v0-import-20250927-002940/from_v0_stat.txt`
- `imports/v0-20250927-003305/` (archived v0 files)

- `GET /api/agents/status` - Agent status
- `POST /api/agents/plan` - Project planning
- `GET /api/agents/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/agents/history` - Execution history

**Migration Path**:

### 2025-01 | Auth & Billing Module Consolidation

**Type**: Refactor  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Impact**: API routes, authentication flow

**Changes**:
- Combined separate auth/billing files into unified module
- Standardized JWT issuance (RS256)
- Unified credit tracking
- Consistent header-based authentication

**Before**:
```
/packages/api/lib/billing.mjs
/packages/api/lib/tokens.mjs
/packages/api/routes/auth.ts
```

**After**:
```
/packages/api/src/modules/auth_billing.ts
```

**Migration Path**:
Internal refactor only. No API changes required.

**Breaking Changes**: None

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for auth/billing
- Easier to maintain and test
- Reduced code duplication
- Clearer module boundaries

### 2025-01 | KV_PREFS Namespace Addition

**Type**: Feature Addition  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Impact**: API Worker bindings, voice preferences

**Description**:
Added new KV namespace for user and voice preferences storage, separate from billing data.

**New Binding**:
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "KV_PREFS"
id = "your-kv-prefs-id"
```

**New Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/voice/prefs` - Get voice preferences
- `PUT /api/voice/prefs` - Update voice preferences

**Migration Path**:
1. Create new KV namespace in Cloudflare
2. Add binding to `wrangler.toml`
3. Deploy updated worker

**Breaking Changes**: None (additive feature)

---

### 2025-01 | CORS Standardization

**Type**: Refactor  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Impact**: API middleware, all endpoints

**Description**:
Unified CORS implementation with environment-driven configuration and proper preflight handling.

**Changes**:
- Single CORS middleware for all routes
- Environment variable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (CSV format)
- Proper `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` for billing/usage
- Correct preflight (OPTIONS) responses

**Before**: Multiple CORS implementations across routes

**After**: Single middleware in `index.ts`

```typescript
// Environment-driven CORS
const allowedOrigins = env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || [];

app.use('*', async (c, next) => {
  const origin = c.req.header('Origin');
  if (origin && allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
    c.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
    // ... additional headers
  }
  await next();
});
```

**Migration Path**:
Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable in Worker settings.

**Breaking Changes**: None (behavior improved, not changed)

### 2025-01 | PowerShell-First Approach

**Type**: Policy  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Impact**: Documentation, scripts, CI/CD

**Description**:
Standardized on PowerShell for all scripts and commands (Windows-first development).

**Changes**:
- All scripts in `/scripts/` are PowerShell (.ps1)
- Documentation uses PowerShell examples
- CI/CD remains bash (GitHub Actions on Linux)

**Rationale**:
- Primary development environment is Windows
- PowerShell is cross-platform
- Better Windows integration
- Consistent with 00-RULES.md

**Migration Path**:
Convert any bash scripts to PowerShell equivalents.

**Example Conversion**:
```bash
# Before (bash)
cd packages/api
npm run dev

# After (PowerShell)
Set-Location packages\api
npm run dev
```

### 2025-01 | GitHub-Only Deployment Policy

**Type**: Policy  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Impact**: Deployment process, CI/CD

**Description**:
Enforced GitHub-only deployment policy to prevent configuration drift.

**Policy**:
- ❌ No direct `wrangler publish` to production
- ❌ No manual Cloudflare dashboard changes
- ✅ All changes via GitHub PR → main → CI/CD
- ✅ All configuration in repository

**Rationale**:
- Prevents drift between code and deployed config
- Maintains audit trail
- Enables rollback via git
- Ensures reproducible deployments

**Migration Path**:
All production changes must go through GitHub Actions workflows.

**Emergency Procedure**:
If manual intervention required:
1. Document changes
2. Create PR to sync repository
3. Get approval and merge
