# AutonomousGoalAgent

A sophisticated AI agent for autonomous goal decomposition, execution planning, progress monitoring, and adaptive replanning.

## Overview

The AutonomousGoalAgent is designed to take high-level goals and autonomously:
1. **Decompose** them into manageable subgoals
2. **Create** detailed execution plans
3. **Monitor** progress in real-time
4. **Replan** when obstacles are encountered
5. **Execute** goals with dependency management

## Key Features

### ðŸŒ² Hierarchical Goal Trees
- Represent goals in a tree structure with parent-child relationships
- Track dependencies between goals
- Calculate progress recursively
- Identify critical paths for prioritization

### ðŸ“Š Progress Monitoring
- Real-time progress tracking with metrics
- Velocity calculation for time estimation
- Automated risk detection (low velocity, blockers, dependencies)
- Bottleneck identification
- Alert system for critical issues

### ðŸ“‹ Execution Planning

## Core Interfaces

### GoalTree
Manages hierarchical goal structures:
```typescript
interface GoalTree {
  rootId: string;
  nodes: Map<string, GoalNode>;
  
  // Core operations
  addGoal(goal: GoalNode, parentId?: string): void;
  removeGoal(goalId: string): void;
  updateGoal(goalId: string, updates: Partial<GoalNode>): void;
  
  // Analysis operations
  getProgress(goalId: string): number;
  isBlocked(goalId: string): boolean;
  canStart(goalId: string): boolean;
  getCriticalPath(): string[];
}
```

### GoalProgressMonitor
Tracks and analyzes goal progress:
```typescript
interface GoalProgressMonitor {
  // Progress tracking
  updateProgress(goalId: string, progress: number): void;
  getProgress(goalId: string): ProgressMetrics | undefined;
  
  // Risk management
  detectRisks(goalId: string): RiskFactor[];
  addRisk(risk: RiskFactor): void;
  
  // Performance metrics
  calculateVelocity(goalId: string): number;
  estimateCompletion(goalId: string): number;
  identifyBottlenecks(): string[];
  
  // Decision support
  shouldReplan(goalId: string): boolean;
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { AutonomousGoalAgent } from './autonomous-goal-agent';
import { AgentTask } from './types';

// Create and initialize agent
const agent = new AutonomousGoalAgent();
await agent.initialize();

// 1. Decompose a high-level goal
const decomposeTask: AgentTask = {
  id: 'task-1',
  type: 'planning',
  payload: {
    action: 'decompose-goal',
    goalDescription: 'Build a machine learning pipeline',
    priority: 8,
    constraints: ['Must be scalable', 'Must comply with regulations'],
  },
  priority: 10,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
};

const result = await agent.execute(decomposeTask);
const goalId = result.data.goalId;

// 2. Create execution plan
const planTask: AgentTask = {
  id: 'task-2',
  type: 'planning',
  payload: {
    action: 'create-execution-plan',
    goalId,
  },
  priority: 10,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
};

await agent.execute(planTask);

// 3. Execute the goal
const executeTask: AgentTask = {
  id: 'task-3',
  type: 'planning',
  payload: {
    action: 'execute-goal',
    goalId,
  },
  priority: 10,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
};

await agent.execute(executeTask);

// 4. Monitor progress
const monitorTask: AgentTask = {
  id: 'task-4',
  type: 'planning',
  payload: {
    action: 'monitor-progress',
    goalId,
  },
  priority: 10,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
};

const monitorResult = await agent.execute(monitorTask);

// 5. Replan if needed
if (monitorResult.data.needsReplan) {
  const replanTask: AgentTask = {
    id: 'task-5',
    type: 'planning',
    payload: {
      action: 'replan',
      goalId,
      reason: 'Low velocity detected',
    },
    priority: 10,
    createdAt: Date.now(),
  };
  
  await agent.execute(replanTask);
}
```

### Advanced Usage: Direct Access

```typescript
// Access goal tree directly for fine-grained control
const goalTree = agent.getGoalTree(goalId);
if (goalTree) {
  const rootGoal = goalTree.getGoal(goalTree.rootId);
  const children = goalTree.getChildren(goalTree.rootId);
  const criticalPath = goalTree.getCriticalPath();
  const progress = goalTree.getProgress(goalTree.rootId);
}

// Access progress monitor for detailed metrics
const monitor = agent.getProgressMonitor(goalId);
if (monitor) {
  const metrics = monitor.getProgress(goalId);
  const bottlenecks = monitor.identifyBottlenecks();
  const risks = monitor.detectRisks(goalId);
}

// Get execution plan
const executionPlan = agent.getExecutionPlan(planId);
```

## Supported Actions

The agent supports the following actions via the `execute()` method:

| Action | Description | Payload Parameters |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| `decompose-goal` | Decompose a high-level goal into subgoals | `goalDescription`, `priority`, `constraints` |
| `create-execution-plan` | Create an execution plan for a goal | `goalId` |
| `monitor-progress` | Monitor goal progress and detect issues | `goalId` |
| `replan` | Replan goal execution when issues detected | `goalId`, `reason` |
| `execute-goal` | Execute ready goals autonomously | `goalId` |

## Decomposition Strategies

The agent uses three main strategies for goal decomposition:

1. **Sequential**: For concrete goals with clear step-by-step execution
   - Analysis â†’ Implementation â†’ Testing â†’ Deployment

2. **Parallel**: For goals with independent components
   - Research, Design, Infrastructure, Documentation (can run in parallel)

3. **Hierarchical**: For complex, abstract goals
   - Break down â†’ Identify dependencies â†’ Create plan â†’ Execute & integrate

The strategy is automatically selected based on:
- Goal complexity (higher = hierarchical)
- Goal type (concrete = sequential, abstract = parallel)
- Dependencies (many = sequential, few = parallel)

## Progress Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- **Overall Progress**: 0-1 scale based on completed subgoals
- **Velocity**: Goals completed per unit time
- **Efficiency**: Actual vs estimated effort ratio
- **Blockers**: Dependencies preventing goal execution
- **Risks**: Detected issues that may impact success

### Risk Detection
Automatically detects:
- Low velocity (progress slower than expected)
- Active blockers (dependencies not met)
- High-risk conditions based on probability and impact

### Replanning Triggers
Replanning is triggered when:
- Velocity < 0.2 (very slow progress)
- More than 2 active blockers
- Critical severity risks detected

## Integration with Orchestrator

The AutonomousGoalAgent is designed to work seamlessly with the orchestrator:

```typescript
import { FullStackAIAssistant } from './fullstack-ai-assistant';

const orchestrator = new FullStackAIAssistant();
await orchestrator.initialize();

// The orchestrator can delegate goal-related tasks to AutonomousGoalAgent
const task: AgentTask = {
  id: 'orchestrator-task-1',
  type: 'planning',
  payload: {
    action: 'decompose-goal',
    goalDescription: 'Create a full-stack application',
    priority: 10,
  },
  priority: 10,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
};

const result = await orchestrator.execute(task);
```

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Simple Goal Execution
1. Decompose goal â†’ Get goal ID
2. Create execution plan â†’ Get plan ID
3. Execute goal â†’ Monitor execution
4. Check completion

### Workflow 2: Monitored Execution with Replanning
1. Decompose goal
2. Create execution plan
3. Execute goal
4. Monitor progress in loop:
   - If progress OK: Continue execution
   - If needs replan: Replan and continue
   - If complete: Exit
5. Report final status

### Workflow 3: Multiple Interdependent Goals
1. Decompose multiple goals
2. Link goals via dependencies in goal tree
3. Create execution plans for each
4. Execute goals respecting dependencies
5. Monitor all goals centrally
6. Replan individual goals as needed

## Best Practices

1. **Start with clear goal descriptions**: The more specific the goal, the better the decomposition
2. **Specify constraints**: Help the agent avoid invalid decompositions
3. **Monitor regularly**: Check progress periodically to catch issues early
4. **Trust automatic replanning**: The agent will replan when needed
5. **Use direct access for debugging**: Access GoalTree and Monitor for detailed insights
6. **Set appropriate priorities**: Higher priority goals get more attention

## Limitations

- Goal execution is simulated (90% success rate by default)
- Resource allocation is theoretical (identifies needs but doesn't allocate)
- Single-threaded execution (executes up to 3 goals in parallel)
- No persistent storage (goals only exist in memory)

## Future Enhancements

- Persistent goal storage
- Integration with actual execution engines
- Learning from execution history
- Advanced resource allocation algorithms
- Multi-agent goal coordination
- Natural language goal interpretation
- Visual goal tree representation
