# EthicsAlignmentAgent

Real-time value alignment and ethical compliance monitoring agent for the Cognomega multi-agent system.

## Overview

The `EthicsAlignmentAgent` is a specialized agent that provides comprehensive ethical evaluation of AI outputs, plans, and actions. It assesses ethical risks, detects biases, evaluates fairness, ensures regulatory compliance, and continuously learns from feedback to improve its assessments.

## Features

### 1. Ethical Risk Assessment
- Evaluates outputs and plans for potential ethical concerns
- Assigns risk levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`
- Provides overall assessment: `ethically-sound`, `minor-concerns`, `major-concerns`, `ethically-problematic`

### 2. Principle Analysis
Evaluates six core ethical principles:
- **Autonomy**: Preservation of user choice and decision-making
- **Beneficence**: Positive outcomes and benefits to stakeholders
- **Non-Maleficence**: Prevention of harm and negative consequences
- **Justice**: Fair distribution of benefits and equitable treatment
- **Transparency**: Openness and clarity in processes and decisions
- **Accountability**: Responsibility and oversight mechanisms

### 3. Bias Detection
Identifies various types of bias:
- **Demographic bias**: Exclusion or unfair treatment of groups
- **Cognitive bias**: Confirmation bias, anchoring, etc.
- **Algorithmic bias**: Systematic errors in automated decisions
- **Selection bias**: Non-random selection of data or participants
- **Confirmation bias**: Favoring information that confirms existing beliefs

### 4. Fairness Assessment
Evaluates fairness across three dimensions:
- **Distributional Fairness**: Equal distribution of benefits and burdens
- **Procedural Fairness**: Consistent and transparent processes
- **Representational Fairness**: Diverse and inclusive representation

### 5. Compliance Checking
Validates compliance with:
- **Regulatory frameworks**: GDPR, CCPA, AI Ethics Guidelines
- **Organizational policies**: Data privacy, security, acceptable use
- **User principles**: Safety, privacy, autonomy

### 6. Stakeholder Impact Analysis
- Identifies affected stakeholders
- Assesses impact type: `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`, `mixed`
- Evaluates magnitude: `negligible`, `minor`, `moderate`, `major`, `critical`
- Provides mitigation strategies

### 7. Continuous Learning
- Stores feedback history (last 1000 assessments)
- Updates learned patterns based on real-world outcomes
- Improves assessment accuracy over time
- Adapts to organization-specific contexts

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { EthicsAlignmentAgent } from '@cognomega/si-core/v0/agents';

// Create and initialize the agent
const ethicsAgent = new EthicsAlignmentAgent();
await ethicsAgent.initialize();

// Create a task for ethical evaluation
const task = {
  id: 'task-001',
  type: 'ethics',
  payload: {
    action: 'Create user feature',
    description: 'Build a dashboard with privacy controls and user consent',
    context: 'User-facing feature development',
  },
  priority: 5,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
};

// Execute ethical assessment
const result = await ethicsAgent.execute(task);

if (result.success) {
  const assessment = result.data.assessment;
  console.log('Overall Assessment:', assessment.overallAssessment);
  console.log('Risk Level:', assessment.riskLevel);
  console.log('Approved:', result.data.approved);
  
  if (result.data.interventionRequired) {
    console.log('Corrective Actions:', assessment.correctiveActions);
  }
}
```

### Integration with SuperIntelligenceEngine

The agent is automatically registered when using the multi-agent system integration:

```typescript
import { createEnhancedSuperIntelligence } from '@cognomega/si-core/v0/agents';

const engine = createEnhancedSuperIntelligence();

// The EthicsAlignmentAgent is now available as 'EthicsAlignmentAgent'
const agents = engine.getAgents();
console.log('Registered agents:', agents);
```

### Feedback Learning

Update the agent with real-world outcomes to improve future assessments:

```typescript
await ethicsAgent.updateFromFeedback(
  'task-001',
  'Feature implemented successfully with positive user reception',
  'Users appreciated the clear consent mechanism and privacy controls'
);
```

## Assessment Result Structure

```typescript
interface EthicalAssessment {
  overallAssessment: 'ethically-sound' | 'minor-concerns' | 'major-concerns' | 'ethically-problematic';
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  confidence: number; // 0-1
  principleAnalysis: PrincipleAnalysis;
  biasDetection: BiasAnalysis;
  fairnessAssessment: FairnessAssessment;
  complianceCheck: ComplianceResult;
  stakeholderImpacts: StakeholderImpact[];
  recommendations: string[];
  correctiveActions: string[];
}
```

## Configuration

### Ethical Thresholds

The agent uses configurable thresholds for each principle (default values):

```typescript
{
  autonomy: 0.7,
  beneficence: 0.75,
  nonMaleficence: 0.8,  // Highest threshold for harm prevention
  justice: 0.7,
  transparency: 0.75,
  accountability: 0.7,
}
```

### Priority

The agent operates at priority level `9` (high priority) to ensure ethical evaluations are performed before critical actions.

## Integration Points

### FullStackAIAssistant Orchestrator

The agent is integrated into the `FullStackAIAssistant` orchestrator and can be invoked as part of multi-agent workflows:

```typescript
const assistant = new FullStackAIAssistant();
// EthicsAlignmentAgent is automatically available
```

### SuperIntelligenceEngine

Registered in the engine's agent registry:

```typescript
// Available as 'EthicsAlignmentAgent' in the engine
engine.registerAgent('EthicsAlignmentAgent', handler);
```

## Examples

See `ethics-alignment-example.ts` for comprehensive usage examples including:

1. Evaluating an ethically sound request
2. Identifying ethical concerns
3. Detecting bias
4. Blocking harmful requests
5. Feedback learning

Run the examples:

```typescript
import { runAllExamples } from '@cognomega/si-core/v0/agents/ethics-alignment-example';

await runAllExamples();
```

## Decision Flow

```
Input Task → Principle Analysis → Bias Detection → Fairness Assessment
     ↓              ↓                   ↓                 ↓
Compliance Check → Stakeholder Impact → Overall Assessment
     ↓
Risk Level Determination
     ↓
Intervention Required? → Corrective Actions
     ↓
Store Feedback → Update Learned Patterns
```

## Best Practices

1. **Early Integration**: Integrate ethics evaluation early in the development pipeline
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Use for real-time monitoring of AI system outputs
3. **Feedback Loop**: Regularly provide feedback to improve assessment accuracy
4. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust ethical thresholds based on organizational requirements
5. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Consider all affected stakeholders in assessments
6. **Transparency**: Make ethics assessments visible to relevant stakeholders
7. **Corrective Action**: Always implement recommended corrective actions for high-risk items

## Limitations

- Pattern recognition based on keywords and content analysis
- Requires feedback to improve accuracy in domain-specific contexts
- Cannot replace human ethical review for critical decisions
- Assessments are probabilistic and should be validated

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Integration with external ethics frameworks and databases
- Multi-language support for international compliance
- Advanced NLP for deeper semantic understanding
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Integration with regulatory reporting systems
- Custom principle definitions per organization
- Explainable AI for assessment reasoning

## Architecture

The agent follows Cognomega's multi-agent architecture:

- **Extends**: `BaseAgent` for standard agent functionality
- **Implements**: `IAgent` interface for orchestrator compatibility
- **Type**: `orchestrator` (cross-cutting concern)
- **Capabilities**: 8 specialized capabilities for comprehensive ethical evaluation

## Contributing

When extending the EthicsAlignmentAgent:

1. Maintain backward compatibility with existing assessments
2. Add tests for new ethical evaluation features
3. Document new principles or evaluation criteria
4. Update thresholds conservatively (err on the side of safety)
5. Provide clear rationale for algorithmic changes
